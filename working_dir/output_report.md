# Latest Recommendations for the Paladin Class in Last Epoch 

Greetings, brave warriors of Eterra! The recent 1.0.4 patch for "Last Epoch" has brought about numerous changes and updates, affecting the gameplay mechanics for our beloved Paladin class. Here's a deep dive into the Paladin's current state and the latest recommendations for an efficient and effective build, based on the new update.

## The Paladin: A Beacon of Light

The Paladin, one of three Mastery classes derived from the mighty Sentinel base class, continues to stand as a beacon of righteousness, battling the forces of darkness with divine justice. The class empowers its allies with its holy aura and healing sigils, allowing them to delve deep into the heart of darkness and eradicate their enemies. This unique trait makes the Paladin a formidable force in both solo and group play.

## Aurelis' Judgement Build: The Holy Exterminator 

The 1.0.4 patch has paved the way for the emergence of the Aurelis' Judgement build. This build focuses on maximizing Smite damage and generating a powerful Consecrated Aura, transforming the Paladin into an unstoppable holy exterminator. Key abilities for this build include Judgement and Holy Aura, while supportive skills like Healing Hands and Javelin further enhance the Paladin's survival and damage capabilities.

## Gear Up for Battle: Unique Items and Passive Skills

The Aurelis' Judgement build leverages the power of unique items, namely Devotion and Aurelis. Devotion increases Spell Damage by +1 for every 5 Mana missing from the Paladin's Mana Pool. Aurelis, on the other hand, allows the Paladin to automatically cast Smite, providing significant penetration for Electrify. Other recommended equipment includes the Titan Heart and Stormtide. The passive skill tree should focus on enhancing the Paladin's survivability, damage output, and mana efficiency.

## Final Thoughts

The Aurelis' Judgement build offers a rotational, bursty playstyle for the Paladin, making it an exciting and powerful option for players following the 1.0.4 patch. However, remember that these recommendations are based on the current state of the game and may be subject to change in future updates. So, get ready to gear up, empower your allies, and bring divine justice to your foes!
